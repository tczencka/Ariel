# Ariel
A tool to help screenwriters find their voice. Input your TV pilot and - using natural language processing - ARIEL identifies "sister scripts" that match your show in tone, topic, and/or theme. Return packet also includes the ideal network for your show, pilot specs, screenplay PDFs for further research, and title pitches. 

<b> Why ARIEL? </b>

To sell work in Hollywood, screenwriters have to pitch their work. Unfortunately, it's not always easy for a writer to flip the switch into salesperson mode. When you've poured your heart and soul into a project, it can be difficult to get the necessary distance to turn a 60-page pilot into a 2-minute elevator pitch. 

The only person who can sell your script is <u>you</u> - but ARIEL can help with the heavy lifting. Through machine learning, ARIEL "reads" your script and pitches it back to you. ARIEL can't tell what you <i>want</i> to write, but if you're an emotive writer (like me) who doesn't know if you're on land or at sea until you get there, ARIEL wll help you re-claim your voice with the gift of perspective: <b><i>this</i> is how your pilot reads on paper.</b>

<b> How ARIEL works </b>

ARIEL conducts three processes: 

1. Collection & Analysis of script features (number of characters, page length, percent dialogue, percent voiceover, etc.)
2. Topic modeling to provide a breakdown of your pilot's "DNA" 
3. Using principal component analysis and clustering algorithms, ARIEL finds "Sister Scripts" used in determining a distribution channel of best fit.

Though it may not look like it at first blush, this is a recommendation engine. Based on your pilot script, ARIEL recommends scripts to read, networks to pitch, as well as potential titles. Sometimes when you set out to write Breaking Bad, you end up with a Malcolm In The Middle script instead. ARIEL helps screenwriters better contextualize their work, find their voice, and chart a direction to forge ahead.
